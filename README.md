This repository contains a handful of RMarkdown files with exercises on cleaning, analyzing and visualizing eye-tracking data.

Data from the Visual Search and Social Engagement experiments are also accessible in this repository.

## Day 4: 8/12/2022

We will work with these Rmd files, which you can find in /Scripts:

All data are in the /data folder except for Sample data (too big for git). These can be found at this Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yp7bzj523u22j96/AAAdF_Zt2LW4-N-08oLhE0h2a?dl=0
